# Weather Wise

## Challenge Statement(s) Addressed 🎯
- How might we inform customers of weather-related flight cancellations before they happen?
- Once a flight is canceled, how can we streamline the customer response, minimize wait times, and empower customers to destress and confidently take their next steps?

## Project Description 🤯
Inclement weather, including thunderstorms, snowstorms, heavy rainfall, strong gusts, and fog, can pose serious risks to flight safety, often resulting in cancellations. Leveraging machine learning techniques, we have developed predictive software capable of estimating the likelihood of flight cancellations. Weather Wise serves as a valuable resource, providing users with calculated probabilities of flight disruptions and aiding them in making informed decisions during irregular operations (IROPS), while also enhancing their understanding of such events.

## Project Value 💰
The primary target audience for Weather Wise includes frequent flyers, travel planners, and airline operational staff who require accurate forecasts to mitigate the impact of flight disruptions. By utilizing Weather Wise, they can benefit from real-time predictions, allowing for proactive planning and reduced downtime or delays associated with adverse weather conditions. Additionally, the tool offers educational insights into weather-related operational challenges, empowering users with knowledge to make informed travel decisions and improve overall travel experiences.
